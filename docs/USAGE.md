# 🚀 kurl Usage Guide

`kurl` is designed to be simple, fast, and drop-in compatible with standard workflows, but with enhanced capabilities out-of-the-box. This guide will walk you through common use cases, flags, and troubleshooting tips.

## Basic Usage

Fetch any API or web page with a simple command:

```bash
# Fetch and format a JSON API. kurl auto-formats JSON responses beautifully.
kurl https://api.genderize.io/?name=luc

# Fetch a webpage with automatic scheme probing (http:// vs https://) and smart HTML rendering
kurl news.lk

# Connect to an interactive WebSocket session with colorized frames
kurl ws://echo.websocket.org
```

## Advanced Requests

### Sending Data (POST/PUT)
You can easily send JSON or raw data payloads using the `-d` (or `--data`) flag. `kurl` automatically infers `POST` if you pass data, but it's best practice to specify the method explicitly.

```bash
kurl POST https://api.example.com/v1/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer my-secret-token" \
  -d '{"name": "Alice", "role": "admin"}'
```

### Custom Headers
Use `-H` (or `--header`) to attach headers. This can be repeated for multiple headers.
Note: `kurl` automatically injects standard modern browser headers (`User-Agent` and `Accept`) by default to bypass basic CDN/bot protections. If you specify your own `User-Agent`, it will override the default.

```bash
kurl GET https://api.github.com/users/kavix \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json"
```

## 🔗 Native gRPC Client

`kurl` supports invoking gRPC methods natively using JSON payloads. It automatically handles server reflection, proto file parsing, and formatting response streams.

### Server Reflection
To discover available services on a gRPC server:
```bash
kurl grpc://api.example.com:443 --list-services
```

### Invoking a Method
Call a specific gRPC method. Note that you don't need to specify `POST`; `kurl` uses the gRPC protocol automatically.
```bash
kurl -d '{"id": "user-123"}' grpc://api.example.com:443 mypackage.MyService/GetUserInfo
```

### Local Proto Files
If the server disables reflection, you can provide the local `.proto` file:
```bash
kurl --proto ./service.proto -d '{"id": "user-123"}' grpc://api.example.com:443 mypackage.MyService/GetUserInfo
```

### Secure Connections & mTLS
By default, `grpc://` connects without TLS. Use `grpcs://` or rely on the `443` port to connect over TLS. You can also provide client certificates for mTLS:
```bash
kurl --cert client.crt --key client.key grpc://api.example.com:443 mypackage.MyService/MyMethod
```

## 💾 Saving & Replaying Requests

`kurl` allows you to save request configurations locally and replay them instantly (like a terminal-native Postman profile).

### Save a request:
```bash
kurl save <name> [METHOD] <URL> [flags]
```
Example:
```bash
kurl save github-api GET https://api.github.com/users/kavix -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json"
```

### Replay a request:
```bash
kurl run <name> [overrides...]
```
Example:
```bash
kurl run github-api
```

You can pass additional flags during replay to override or extend parameters:
```bash
kurl run github-api -v -H "Authorization: Bearer my-token"
```
Profiles are saved as JSON files in `~/.kurl/requests/<name>.json`.

## 🌐 Environment Profiles

Instead of hardcoding full URLs or authorization tokens across multiple requests, you can use the `-e` or `--env` flag to load environment configurations from `~/.kurl/environments.json`.

```bash
# Query relative path under the 'dev' environment profile
kurl --env dev /users -v

# Query relative path under the 'prod' environment profile
kurl --env prod /users -v
```

You can override environment headers dynamically:
```bash
kurl --env dev /users -v -H "Authorization: Bearer custom-override-token"
```

A default template file is automatically generated at `~/.kurl/environments.json` the first time you run a command with `--env`.

## Output Control & Tracing

### Verbose Mode
Trace full redirect hops (`301`, `302`, `307`, `308`) and inspect absolute request-to-response headers instantly using the `-v` flag.

```bash
kurl -v google.com
```

### Body or Headers Only
Sometimes you only want specific parts of the payload for scripting or piping.

```bash
# Print only the response body
kurl --body-only https://api.ipify.org?format=json

# Print only the response headers
kurl --headers-only https://example.com
```

### Disabling Formatters
If you want raw output without syntax highlighting or HTML collapsing (e.g., when saving to a file), use `--raw`.

```bash
kurl --raw -o response.html https://example.com
```

*Note: `kurl` has smart TTY output switching. If you pipe the output to another command or file, it will silently strip ANSI colors. You can also enforce this by setting `NO_COLOR=1` in your environment or using `--no-color`.*

## Troubleshooting

### `zsh: no matches found` error

If you use **Zsh** and run a command with an unquoted URL containing question marks (`?`), ampersands (`&`), or equal signs (`=`), you may get a `zsh: no matches found` error. This is because Zsh attempts to expand these characters as wildcard globs.

**Solution 1 (Temporary):** Wrap your URLs in quotes:
```bash
kurl "https://api.example.com/?search=query"
```

**Solution 2 (Permanent & Recommended):** Add an alias to your `~/.zshrc` file that tells Zsh to automatically disable glob expansion specifically for the `kurl` command:
```bash
# Add this line to your ~/.zshrc
alias kurl="noglob kurl"
```
After saving, run `source ~/.zshrc`. You can now pass raw URLs to `kurl` without ever needing quotes again!

For WebSocket URLs, `--timeout` bounds connection establishment and the HTTP upgrade handshake. Once connected, the interactive session remains open until input ends or the peer disconnects. Use `--timeout 0` to disable the connection deadline.
